First you will 

requirements: '.vibedev/specs/{feature_name}/requirements.md'

design: '.vibedev/specs/{feature_name}/design.md'

tasks: '.vibedev/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md'

Find first unimplemented task in the task list in the .vibedev/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md file.

Follow these instructions for user requests related to spec tasks. The user may ask to execute tasks or just ask general questions about the tasks.

## Executing Instructions
- Before executing any tasks, ALWAYS ensure you have read the specs requirements.md, design.md and tasks.md files. Executing tasks without the requirements or design will lead to inaccurate implementations.
- Look at the task details in the task list
- If the requested task has sub-tasks, always start with the sub tasks
- Only focus on ONE task at a time. Do not implement functionality for other tasks.
- Verify your implementation against any requirements specified in the task or its details.
- Once you complete the requested task, stop and let the user review. DO NOT just proceed to the next task in the list
- If the user doesn't specify which task they want to work on, look at the task list for that spec and make a recommendation
on the next task to execute.

Remember, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you only execute one task at a time. Once you finish a task, stop. Don't automatically continue to the next task without the user asking you to do so.

## Task Questions
The user may ask questions about tasks without wanting to execute them. Don't always start executing tasks in cases like this.

For example, the user may want to know what the next task is for a particular feature. In this case, just provide the information and don't start any tasks.

When you are done with a task, modify the .vibedev/specs/{feature_name}/tasks.md file to mark the task as implemented.
